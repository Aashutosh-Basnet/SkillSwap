# Profile Save Issue - Fixed

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Missing Environment Variables
**Problem**: The API routes were trying to connect to the backend server using `BACKEND_URL` environment variable, but no `.env` files existed.

**Solution**: 
- Created `.env.example` files for both client and server
- Added proper environment variable documentation

### 2. Form Submission Handler Issues  
**Problem**: The form submit handler had unnecessary complexity that could prevent proper submission.

**Solution**:
- Simplified form submission to use `handleSubmit(onSubmit)` directly
- Improved error handling and validation

### 3. Inadequate Error Handling
**Problem**: Limited error feedback made it difficult to diagnose issues.

**Solution**:
- Added comprehensive error handling with specific error messages
- Added debugging logs to API routes
- Added authentication error handling with automatic redirect to login

### 4. Form Validation Issues
**Problem**: The form validation wasn't properly handling edge cases.

**Solution**:
- Added proper validation for required fields (fullname, skills)
- Improved avatar file processing with error handling
- Better state management after successful saves

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create Environment Files

**For Client (`client/.env.local`)**:
```env
# Backend server URL - used by Next.js API routes
BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5000

# Public backend URL - used by client-side code  
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

**For Server (`server/.env`)**:
```env
# MongoDB connection string
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/skillswap

# JWT secret for token signing
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secure_jwt_secret_key_here

# Server port
PORT=5000

# Database name
DB_NAME=skillswap

# CORS origin for frontend
CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000
```

### 2. Start the Servers

1. **Start Backend Server**:
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm start
   ```

2. **Start Frontend Server**:
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm run dev
   ```

### 3. Testing the Fix

1. Go to `/profile` page
2. Click "Edit Profile"
3. Make changes to your profile details
4. Click "Save"
5. Verify the changes are saved and persist after page reload

## Debugging Tools

If you still encounter issues, check:

1. **Browser Console**: Look for error messages in the developer tools
2. **Network Tab**: Check if API requests are being made and their responses
3. **Server Logs**: Check the backend console for error messages
4. **Environment Variables**: Ensure all required env vars are set correctly

## Common Issues and Solutions

### "Authentication failed" Error
- Check if JWT_SECRET is set in server `.env`
- Verify you're logged in with a valid token
- Try logging out and logging back in

### "Internal server error" Error  
- Check if MongoDB is running
- Verify MONGO_URI in server `.env`
- Check server console for detailed error logs

### Profile not saving
- Check browser network tab for failed requests
- Verify BACKEND_URL in client `.env.local`
- Ensure backend server is running on correct port

## Code Changes Made

### Client Changes (`client/app/profile/page.tsx`)
- Enhanced `onSubmit` function with better validation and error handling
- Simplified form submission handler
- Added proper state management after successful saves
- Improved user feedback and error messages

### API Route Changes (`client/app/api/user/profile/route.ts`)
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging
- Enhanced error responses with more details
- Better error handling for network issues

The profile save functionality should now work correctly with proper error handling and user feedback.
